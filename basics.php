            <h2>Basics You Should Know:</h2>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JS - you don't have to master these yet but you certainly should be able to recognize what they are and how to fix and fuss with them. Learn how to google. Almost every question you have has been asked before and you will most likely wind up on stackoverflow to find the answer. Understand what servers, routers, hosts, domains, urls, DOM, APIs, and objects are. If you need help finding a path I've got a FREE one laid out for you below, if you trust. Bwahahaha.

              <h3>HTML and CSS - Everyone's doing it!</h3>
              <p>This is fun and explains the internet <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com">Don't Fear the Internet.</a> Start from the beginning and by the end you should understand how HTML and CSS works. Then go to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">codecademy</a> and go through the Web Fundamentals track. And while your at it go to <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites">Treehouse</a> and go through the free Deep Dives "HTML" and "CSS".</p>

              <h3>Use Code Instantly!</h3>
              <p>If you haven't already downloaded a text editor - this is the time. For mac I suggest <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime</a> and for windows <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++.</a> You should also know how file structures work on your machine. Create a new file in your text editor called index.html and paste this code:</p>
              <pre><code>
                &lt;html>
                  &lt;header>&lt;title>What A Title&lt;/title>&lt;/header>
                  &lt;body>
                    Hello world
                  &lt;/body>
                &lt;/html>
              </code></pre>
              <p>Save the file somewhere on your machine, open a browser - click File : open File (click on your index.html saved file) and "Hello World" should appear in the browser.
              </p>

              <h3>Connecting It All</h3>
              <p>Next you should be able to create a CSS page and link to it in your html page. Then Javascript. WHA??? Go back to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">codecademy</a> and go through jQuery and Javascript tracks. While your at it - why not do the Projects track to tie it all together. Also, go through <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery">Codeschool's jquery</a> and <a href="http://www.learnstreet.com/lessons/study/javascript">Learnstreet's JS</a> courses. This will take you awhile...I'll wait.</p>

              <h3>Because...science</h3>
              <p>Welcome back! This is a good time to step back and understand the basics of computer science. It's not neccessary but it's helpful to understand why code works and doesn't work. I don't have a recommendation beyond wikipedia, but understanding the history and science briefly will help.</p>
              <p>Now is also the time to become familiar with the terminal or console for your machine. Check out <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations/getting-started-with-the-console">Treehouse</a> and the <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Learning Code The Hard Way</a> book. And just fell in love with <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">Eloquent Javascript</a> which breaks down programming, eases you into using the console, and defines terms in a non dry way.</p>
              <img src="./assets/img/DOM.png" id="dom">
              <p>You also need to understand the DOM. DOM DOM DOM! The DOM in an eight minute <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ZcldkGlt8">Video</a> and summed up in the image to the right.</p>
              <p>Let's make sure you understand the browser as well. A great <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/">Article</a> explains this in great detail and does a nice job explaining the DOM tree and parsing as well. Don't worry if you don't understand everything. Just let it wash over you.</p>
              <p>Now the fork in the road. You now know how to do fancy things and display them locally (on your machine's browser). You want everyone to see your great new website, right? Now is the time to dive deeper into languages to become dynamic. Which one first? That is entirely up to you! PHP is similar to JS - Ruby and Python are similar to each other. Learn them all! Or try each out and go with what feels good. Wordpress and Drupal use PHP so if you want to become a freelancer I highly recommend that route. Want to work for a cool start-up and make millions? Then go Ruby and/or Python. C++ and Java are great too, but require a bit more time commitment - this is what college is for! And for you JS lovers, check out Nodejs.
              </p>
              <p>But before jumping into your language of choice - make sure you have a handle on <a href"http://teknadesigns.com/what-is-object-oriented-programming/">Objects</a>. They are what it's all about now. Each language track below will touch on objects as well.</p>

              <p>At some point it's really important to understand version control. Try <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git">Code School</a>. Then <a href="http://gitimmersion.com"> Git Immersion</a>. Then set up a <a href="https://github.com/"> Github</a> account. Also at this point you should have run into some issues and have gotten use to googling your error messages and feel comfortable with navigating stackoverflow. Congrats!</p>
              <p>Speaking of next - We need to talk about databases, frameworks, and how to download all these crazy languages - egads! So many things. I want to grow the site with these and all the things I find fascinating during my personal adventure into web development and if you look close enough ;) you'll see what I mean.</p>
