            <p>Good question. I am a truth-getter, a google extraordinaire - well...basically a newbie that is learning and a critical consumer. In other words...cheap. I went to a boot camp to learn to be a developer and used online learning resources to get to where I am ~ a web developer. Don't like what I preach? That's cool - make your own list. The more the merrier! I just found it hard to find quality sites to learn from and basic understanding of what it all meant so I thought making this site could help fellow newbies, myself included. This is a pretty straight-forward bootstrap template that I tweaked to call my own. Enjoy!</p>
            <p>I've tried out most of the free links listed and very few of the paid links but thought they may be helpful for someone with a bigger billfold than me. Of course all of this will be outdated in about 6 months. If there is any interest then I'll take the time to update it. My hope is that it can grow and someday include ratings, comments, and advanced content.</p>
